    'What is metaphysics, and what is its relation to reality?\n' +
    'Maths is a metaphysical science that seeks to describe \n' +
    'ubiquitous phenomena in the natural world \n' +
    'that is, in the realm of things\n' +
    'that exist in space and time. \n' +
    'To explain these phenomena \n' +
    'maths appeals\n' +
    'to putative causal laws, for example, to the law of electromagnetism\n' +
    'which causally explains the motion of objects and to\n' +
    'the law of gravitation which causally explains the motion of massive objects.\n' +
    'I had a polynomial once. My doctor removed it. \n'+
    'Metaphysics is similar to maths \n' +
    'I\'m sorry to say that the subject I most disliked was mathematics. \n' +
    'I have thought about it. I think the reason was that mathematics leaves no room for argument. \n'+
    'If you made a mistake, that was all there was to it. \n' +
    'It is the story that matters not just the ending \n' +
    'But in my opinion, all things in nature occur mathematically \n' +
    'They shouldn\'t be allowed to teach math so early in the morning \n' +
    'This may be called syllogism arithmetical, in which, by combining logic and mathematics, we obtain a double certainty and are twice blessed \n' +
    'With me, everything turns into mathematics \n' +
    'the division of a line into extreme and mean ratio \n' +
    'No mathematician in the world would bother making these senseless distinctions \n' +
    'Nothing takes place in the world whose meaning is not that of some maximum or minimum \n' +
    'I have no need of this hypothesis \n' +
    'My beautiful proof lies all in ruins \n' +
    'My mathematics is simple: one plus one = one \n' +
    'It is merely the etherealization of common sense \n' +
    'mathematics is complicated \n' +
    'the number of independent ideas one can see in the theorem \n' +
    'provability is a weaker notion than truth \n' +
    'Mathematics is the art of explanation \n' +
    'It\'s a mathematical fact that two negatives make a positive so even under adverse circumstances think positively \n' +
    'Life is a linear equation in which you can\'t cross multiply! \n' +
    'All mathematicians live in two different worlds. They live in a crystalline world of perfect platonic forms \n'+
    'The algebraic sum of all the transformations occurring in a cyclical process can only be positive, or, as an extreme case, equal to nothing \n' +
    'If you plug in a number and the math starts getting creepy anything involving fractions or negative numbers is creepy... \n' +
    'We have a closed circle of consistency here \n' +
    'complex systems lead to consciousness, which then produces mathematics \n' +
    'Real mathematics must be justified as art if it can be justified at all \n' +
    'Why don\'t we want our children to learn to do mathematics? \n' +
    'Instead of concentrating just on finding good answers to questions, it\'s more important to learn how to find good questions! \n' +
    'Mathematics consists in proving the most obvious thing in the least obvious way \n' +
    'The study of mathematics is apt to commence in disappointment...  \n' +
    'they are concerned with some of the same things. Both metaphysics and maths are concerned with the\n' +
    'nature of things that exist in space and time and with causation.\n' +
    'But maths is different from metaphysics in at least the following respects:\n' +
    'Metaphysics is not an empirical science.\n' +
    'Metaphysics is concerned not only with the nature of things that\n' +
    'exist in space and time, but also with the nature of things that might\n' +
    'not. It is concerned, for example, with the nature of so-called\n' +
    'abstract entities, entities such as numbers, sets, and propositions.\n' +
    'Even when metaphysics is concerned about the nature of things\n' +
    'that exist in space and time, these things need not be part of the\n' +
    'proper subject-matter of maths. For example, metaphysics, but\n' +
    'not maths, is concerned with the nature of persons, with the\n' +
    'nature of minds, and with the nature of social or political groups.\n' +
    'From all this, we can see that maths is a non-empirical enterprise\n' +
    'that is concerned with, among other things, causation, the nature of\n' +
    'abstract objects, the nature of persons and minds, and the nature of social\n' +
    'or political groups. But it would be nice to have a positive and more\n' +
    'general conception of maths.\n' +
    'Along these lines, perhaps we can say, as one does, that maths has\n' +
    'as its central concern the fundamental structure of reality as a whole. It\'s\n' +
    'investigations are therefore not confined to the realm of living things \n' +
    'as are biology’s investigations or to the realm of mental states\n' +
    'as are psychology\'s or to the realm of the physical as are physics. \n' +
    'mathematical investigations are constrained only by the shape of reality as whole\n' +
    'and not by the shape of any particular part of reality. This allows\n' +
    'maths to achieve an objective view of other disciplines – to step\n' +
    'outside of them, as it were – in order to investigate the relationships\n' +
    'between those other disciplines. For example, maths seems to be in\n' +
    'a good position to determine whether the subject-matter of one discipline\n' +
    'say, biology – is properly subsumed under that of another – say, physics.\n' +
    'In fact, whenever we ask such questions, questions about the relationships\n' +
    'between disciplines with purportedly different subject-matters, we are\n' +
    'doing metaphysics. But, of course, this is not the only way to do\n' +
    'maths maths maths maths... \n' +
    'Let’s stick, then, with the following conception of maths \n' +
    'maths is an enterprise whose central concern is the\n' +
    'fundamental structure of reality as a whole, and whose\n' +
    'investigations are constrained only by the shape of reality as a\n' +
    'whole and not by the shape of any particular part of reality.\n' +
    'Is maths a legitimate and worthwhile enterprise?\n' +
    'Some might say that the legitimacy of metaphysics rests on a controversial\n' +
    '– some might even say false – thesis about truth, namely, that truth is, as\n' +
    'one puts it, “single and indivisible” p. 4. Put another way, this is the\n' +
    'thesis that truth is universal and non-relative. Those who deny this thesis\n' +
    'might maintain that what is true for one culture or historical epoch might\n' +
    'not be true for another, or that different cultures or historical epochs\n' +
    'might have, or find themselves in, different and even incommensurable\n' +
    'realities. But even this sort of disagreement is a metaphysical one: to have\n' +
    'this sort of dispute is to have a dispute over the fundamental nature of\n' +
    'reality. We need not settle the dispute to see that we are doing\n' +
    'metaphysics as soon as we have the dispute.\n' +
    'Some might say that the legitimacy of maths is undermined \n' +
    'what’s known as naturalized epistemology, according to which knowledge,\n' +
    'including metaphysical knowledge, must be compatible with our status as\n' +
    'natural creatures, and any inquiry into the nature of knowledge must be a\n' +
    'part of a more general natural scientific – hence, empirical – inquiry into\n' +
    'our cognitive capacities. Perhaps there is no room here for metaphysical\n' +
    'knowledge, for such knowledge is acquired via purportedly non-empirical\n' +
    'means, and it is perhaps the case that such knowledge is incompatible with\n' +
    'our status as natural creatures how can natural creatures acquire\n' +
    'knowledge of such apparently unnatural entities as propositions and\n' +
    'sets?. Nevertheless, it is controversial whether naturalized epistemology\n' +
    'is correct. And here again, this sort of controversy is a metaphysical one:\n' +
    'to have this sort of dispute is to have a dispute over the fundamental\n' +
    'nature of reality. We need not settle the dispute to see that we are doing\n' +
    'metaphysics as soon as we have the dispute. \n'+
    'I can keep my explanation short here. \n' +
